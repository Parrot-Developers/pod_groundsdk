/// Gamepad peripheral for `skyCtrl4` remote control devices.
///
/// This peripheral allows:
/// * To receive events when physical inputs (buttons/axes) on the device are triggered.
/// * To configure mappings between combinations of physical inputs and predefined actions to execute or
/// events to forward to the application when such combinations are triggered.
///
/// To start receiving events, a set of `SkyCtrl4Button` and `SkyCtrl4Axis` must be grabbed and
/// and some event listener has to be provided.
///
/// When a gamepad input is grabbed, the remote control will stop forwarding events associated to this input to the
/// connected drone (if any) and instead forward those events to the application-provided listener.
///
/// Each input may produce at least one, but possibly multiple specific events, which is documented in
/// `SkyCtrl4Button` and `SkyCtrl4Axis`.
///
/// To stop receiving events, the input must be ungrabbed, and by doing so the remote control will resume forwarding
/// that input events back to the connected drone instead, or, if the `VirtualGamepad` was grabbing navigation events,
/// it will receive again the navigation events.
///
/// Alternatively the application can unregister its event listeners to stop receiving events from all grabbed inputs
/// altogether. Note, however, that doing so does not release any input, so the drone still won't receive the grabbed
/// input events.
///
/// To receive input events, the application must register some listener to which those event will be forwarded.
/// Event listeners come in two kind, depending on the event to be listened to:
/// * A `(_ event: SkyCtrl4ButtonEvent, _ state: SkyCtrl4ButtonEventState) -> Void` that receives events from inputs
/// producing `SkyCtrl4ButtonEvent` events.
/// This listener also provides the physical state of the associated input, i.e. whether the associated button is
/// `.pressed` or `.released`.
/// Note that physical axes produce a button press event every time they reach the start or end of their course,
/// and a button release event every time they quit that position.
/// * A `(_ event: SkyCtrl4AxisEvent, _ value: Int) -> Void` that receives events from inputs producing
/// `SkyCtrl4AxisEvent` events.
/// This listener also provides the current value of the associated input, i.e. an int value in range [-100, 100]
/// that represents the current position of the axis, where -100 corresponds to the axis at start of its course
/// (left for horizontal axes, down for vertical axes), and 100 represents the axis at end of its course
/// (right for horizontal axes, up for vertical axes).
///
/// A mapping defines a set of actions that may each be triggered by a specific combination of inputs events
/// (buttons, and/or axes) produced by the remote control.
/// Those mappings can be edited and are persisted on the remote control device: entries can be modified, removed,
/// and new entries can be added as well.
///
/// A `SkyCtrl4MappingEntry` in a mapping defines the association between such an action, the drone model on which
/// it should apply, and the combination of input events that should trigger the action.
/// Two different kind of entries are available:
///   - a `SkyCtrl4ButtonsMappingEntry` entry allows to trigger a `SkyCtrl4ButtonsMappableAction` when the gamepad
///     inputs produce some set of `SkyCtrl4ButtonEvent` in the `.pressed` state.
///   - a `SkyCtrl4AxisMappingEntry` entry allows to trigger an `SkyCtrl4AxisMappableAction` when the gamepad inputs
///     produce some `SkyCtrl4AxisEvent`, optionally in conjunction with some set of
///     `SkyCtrl4ButtonEvent` in the `.pressed` state.
